First I tried to find some video from mentioned link, but I couldn't find it. any subject that I chose, ended up here:

No link to video, UI was so bad and design was so messy. Then I tried to find sth from youtube. 

FreePBX, a widely-used phone system software, blends open-source and closed-source components. This report dives into FreePBX, focusing on its security and code obfuscation challenges. FreePBX uses ionCube, a tool that hides parts of its code. Although FreePBX says it's open-source, hidden parts raise concerns about transparency.
Understanding hidden code is hard, especially since there aren't free tools to decrypt it. The review of FreePBX found big security problems, like ways for bad people to get in without permission and do dangerous commands. Even though the issues were told to Sangoma, they didn't fix them properly, showing they need to do better at listening and fixing problems quickly.
The discussion focuses on big security issues with PBX systems. It says we need strong security to stop bad people and manage who can do what. Handling permissions in PBX setups is hard and needs careful planning for security.
Overall, the discussion was about the security problems with FreePBX and its code hiding. We said it's important to be open about security issues, fix them fast, and work together to make PBX systems safer.
