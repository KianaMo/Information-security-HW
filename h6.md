### 7 Things You Should Know About Tor

Tor Still Works: Tor keeps your online stuff private, even though some people try to crack it.
Good People Use It Too: It's not just for bad guys; normal folks use Tor to stay safe online.
No Sneaky Military Stuff: Tor doesn't have any secret military stuff; experts made sure it's safe.
No Trouble for Helpers: Nobody has been punished for using Tor in the US, but it's smart to be careful.
Easy to Use: Tor isn't tricky; there are easy tools like Tor Browser Bundle to use.
Not Crazy Slow: Tor used to be slow, but now it's faster because they've made it better.
Not Perfect: Tor isn't perfect; you can mess up your privacy if you don't use it right.

### Hiding Behind the Keyboard: The Tor Browser 
Tor is a special internet browser that hides your identity when you go online. It's easy to use and free to download. It was created by the US government in 2002, but now anyone can help make it better. People use Tor to do good things like sharing information safely, but it can also be used for bad stuff. Even though it started with the government, Tor is now run by a lot of different people from all over the world who want to keep it working well. It's kind of funny that the same government that made Tor is also trying to figure out how to uncover the identities of its users.
Tor works like sending a secret letter through different people to hide where it started. Each person adds a layer of protection, like an envelope, so nobody can see what's inside. When the letter gets to the end, the layers are taken off, and the message is shown. This makes it really hard for anyone to know where the letter came from. But sometimes, innocent people who help with Tor can get in trouble. Like in one case, someone's computers were taken because bad stuff was linked to their IP address, even though they were just helping with Tor.

Tracking people using Tor is really hard for everyone, not just you. Governments are trying to figure it out to catch bad guys or control internet use. Sometimes they succeed, but usually, they catch people because of mistakes, not because they broke Tor. Tor can be broken, like when the FBI took down a bad website. But the biggest problem with Tor is the person using it. Changing settings or using certain things can give away information, making it easier to find them. There are ways to catch Tor users, like sending emails with tracking codes or looking for clues on the regular internet. Most cases are solved because people make mistakes, like using a regular browser by accident.

## a)

To get started, first, we download the Tor browser from the original website for Linux in a virtual machine.

It will be saved as a .tar.xz file. Then, we need to install the browser using either the command line or graphical interface. (I did it graphicsl) We should extract the file for use from the extract manager.

After that, we need to right-click on start-tor-browser.desktop, open properties, and change permissions to allow executing the file as a program (with read and write access).

Now we can start browsing. I used Ahmia search engine same as class.

## b)
As mentiond I used Ahmia for searching and browsing.

Forums also exist, and different kinds of discussions exist there:

Legal companies with real addresses might have web pages on the deep web for privacy, security, and reaching specialized audiences. It helps them protect sensitive information, stay anonymous, and avoid censorship. They may also have technical reasons for using deep web hosting.
