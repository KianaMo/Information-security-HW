### ONE-WAY FUNCTIONS:

- One-way functions are crucial in cryptography.
- They're easy to compute but hard to reverse. (For instance, breaking a plate into pieces is simple, but putting it back together is tough.)
-  Although we lack solid proof of their existence, many functions seem one-way.
- One-way functions with a secret feature make computation easy in one direction but hard in the other, unless you know the secret. For example, taking apart and putting back together a watch illustrates this concept.

### ONE-WAY HASH FUNCTIONS

A one-way hash function is super important in modern cryptography. It takes any length of input and crunches it down to a fixed-size output, kind of like making a fingerprint of the input. It's easy to get this fingerprint from the original input, but almost impossible to figure out the original input from just the fingerprint. A good one also makes it really hard to find two different inputs that give the same fingerprint.

One cool use of a one-way hash function is in verifying files. Say you want to make sure someone has the same file as you without them sending it to you. You can just ask them for the fingerprint (or hash value) of the file. If it matches yours, you're pretty confident they have the same file. This is super handy for things like financial transactions, where you want to make sure nothing gets changed without permission.

Message authentication codes (MACs) take this idea a step further by adding a secret key. This means only folks with the key can check the fingerprint. You can make a MAC using a hash function, encryption algorithms, or specialized MAC algorithms.

## a)
For installing the hashcat I followed the instruction, then I downloaded "rockyou" library:

Then I started by analyzing the test hashed value to learn the proccess. first step is to let hashcat know the type of the hash to crack, the number for the -m parameter. In hashid, the "-m" parameter tells you the type of hashing algorithm used in the password hash. Similarly, in hashcat, the "-m" parameter serves the same purpose. Usually, the correct algorithm is among the top three candidates suggested by hashid. If it's not, you can often narrow down the options based on where the hash was generated, such as on a Windows or Linux system.

Then cracking process is continues. In "status" field we can see if the cracking was successful or not. It might check with the dictionary and don't see the word then the status will be: "Status: Exhausted"

Here we can see the example password:

## b) 
Now we start by cracking this hash: eb8e307a6d649bc7fb51443a06a216f

Status for this hash is also "cracked" so the code was founded in the library:

The real password was february:
