### ONE-WAY FUNCTIONS:

- One-way functions are crucial in cryptography.
- They're easy to compute but hard to reverse. (For instance, breaking a plate into pieces is simple, but putting it back together is tough.)
-  Although we lack solid proof of their existence, many functions seem one-way.
- One-way functions with a secret feature make computation easy in one direction but hard in the other, unless you know the secret. For example, taking apart and putting back together a watch illustrates this concept.
