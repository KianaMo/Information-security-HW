#### Braiterman et al 2020:

- Threat modeling is about the analysis of a system's display highlighting concerns about security and privacy features.

- We should ask 4 key questions for the analysis: (What are we working on, What can go wrong, What are we going to do about it, Did we do a good enough job)

- Anyone who cares about privacy, safety, and security should use threat modeling.

- Using the manifesto is like a guide that develops or modifies a method that is suitable for your needs.

- We value solving design problems, working together, understanding, proactively doing threat modeling and continuous improvement in a single delivery.

- Make security better by analyzing threats early and often, Match threat modeling with how the organization develops, adjusting for design changes, Ensure threat modeling results matter to the people involved, and Talk to understand, document for records, and measure progress.

#### Shostack 2022:
- We use Threat modeling to predict the problems in first stage of project, so it's not expensive to deal with them.

- What are we working on/ What can go wrong/ What we can do for it/ did we do a good job

- In concept of "What are we working on" we can talk about "collabration" that means modelers can branstrorm and integrate their ideas.

- In concept of "What are we working on" we can also talk about "sketching" which means write the first idea as start point in a form that we can use it for answering the question "What can go wrong"

- For keeping record of "What are we working on" we can use "sketching" or "collabration" but in some projects it might not be satisfying, and some proper documantation might be needed. In this cases we should use some tools.

- Then we can talk about "data flow diagram" which is related to Thread modeling, because threads are following data. there are five symbols in them: They are external entities anything outside of control (sharp shape)/ second elemen refers to processes which are under control (not sharp)/ connectors/ drums for showing where is data stors/ trust boundary, to show different elements are operated by different entities.
  
- If answering to question "What can go wrong" is challenging but asking about concerns is the first step.

- Although people have different ways of thinking and different roles, their opinions about "What can go wrong" has a consistency. The way that we add the consistancy can vary, but it has a kind of structure. One of the most important ones is STRIDE which stands for: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of Privileges.

- "What can we do for it?" Based on roles, anyone can do different action, but generally we are going to track the process.
