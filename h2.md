#### Braiterman et al 2020:

- Threat modeling is about the analysis of a system's display highlighting concerns about security and privacy features.

- We should ask 4 key questions for the analysis: (What are we working on, What can go wrong, What are we going to do about it, Did we do a good enough job)

- Anyone who cares about privacy, safety, and security should use threat modeling.

- Using the manifesto is like a guide that develops or modifies a method that is suitable for your needs.

- We value solving design problems, working together, understanding, proactively doing threat modeling and continuous improvement in a single delivery.

- Make security better by analyzing threats early and often, Match threat modeling with how the organization develops, adjusting for design changes, Ensure threat modeling results matter to the people involved, and Talk to understand, document for records, and measure progress.

#### Shostack 2022:
- We use Threat modeling to predict the problems in first stage of project, so it's not expensive to deal with them.

- What are we working on/ What can go wrong/ What we can do for it/ did we do a good job

- In concept of "What are we working on" we can talk about "collabration" that means modelers can branstrorm and integrate their ideas.

- In concept of "What are we working on" we can also talk about "sketching" which means write the first idea as start point in a form that we can use it for answering the question "What can go wrong"

- For keeping record of "What are we working on" we can use "sketching" or "collabration" but in some projects it might not be satisfying, and some proper documantation might be needed. In this cases we should use some tools.

- Then we can talk about "data flow diagram" which is related to Thread modeling, because threads are following data. there are five symbols in them: They are external entities anything outside of control (sharp shape)/ second elemen refers to processes which are under control (not sharp)/ connectors/ drums for showing where is data stors/ trust boundary, to show different elements are operated by different entities.
  
- If answering to question "What can go wrong" is challenging but asking about concerns is the first step.

- Although people have different ways of thinking and different roles, their opinions about "What can go wrong" has a consistency. The way that we add the consistancy can vary, but it has a kind of structure. One of the most important ones is STRIDE which stands for: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of Privileges.

- "What can we do for it?" Based on roles, anyone can do different action, but generally we are going to track the process.

- Risk management is applied to a subset of the threats we discover. It is related to "What we can do for it".

- To answer the question: "did we do a good job" we should ask "Do we recomend this modelling to anyone else?"

  #### Shostack 2014:

Threat modeling is something anyone can and should learn. It's about finding security issues using abstract models, looking at the bigger picture beyond the code. These models help catch problems early, even in things not yet built. The focus is on practical learning, like playing an instrument, where practice makes it easier. The book provides a simple four-step guide to develop your threat modeling skills through experience.

#### OWASP CheatSheets Series Team 2021

This guide is about understanding and fixing security issues in modern applications with threat modeling. Threat modeling is a structured process that helps plan for security by looking at the system from a security viewpoint. It's something to be done in first step and continues during development. The guide follows four key questions from the Threat Model Manifesto we can ask these questions: (What are we working on, What can go wrong, What are we going to do about it, Did we do a good enough job)
The benefits of threat modeling include: clearer view of the system, increased security awareness, early detection of issues. The process has four steps: understanding the program, identifying and ranking threats, planning responses, and review and validation. Each step helps build a secure system, with a focus on learning through hands-on experience.

### a)

In the first step of developing any process, it's essential to ask those four important questions mentioned earlier to recognize the risks that threaten security. Then, we can figure out what needs to be done to address them. In daily life, we use passwords to secure our data on various platforms. One basic action is using a strong enough password. Another important step is not sharing credentials, which is crucial for protecting your data.
For things a bit more advanced, like using two locks instead of one, keeping your computer updated and using two-factor authentication can give extra protection. These steps need a bit more tech knowledge, but they make your online stuff even safer.

### b)

I own a psychology clinic with a total of 25 employees, including seven psychologists. We utilize a booking system for patients to discover doctors and their schedules, allowing them to book appointments. Additionally, there is another app designed for doctors to access patient information. For simplicity, let's focus on analyzing the patient app's system. Our database contains patient information, including stories, previous bookings, prescriptions, backgrounds, and medical history. It also stores details about doctors' schedules. We aim to use threat modeling to address security concerns associated with using this app.

#### What are we working on?

This is the reservation system and related databases crucial to this process. The key asset is patients' information because it is about their privacy. If this data were to be stolen, someone could misuse it against our customers, potentially breaking their trust.

In this system, we have the most critical data that requires protection. It includes sensitive credentials such as addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, disease stories, and occasionally secret stories that patients haven't shared with anyone else. Any of this information could be maliciously used against our customers, potentially posing threats to their social standing, health, and even their lives. The lack of security could lead to various types of attacks, resulting in a loss of customer trust and losing customers means losing business.

#### What can go wrong?

Using STRIDE Model:
Based on STRIDE modelling we should do analysis the related terms in this special case.

##### Spoofing:

Risk: Someone might pretend to be someone else and could sign in to their accounts to get into patient info. 
How to Stay Safe: Make sure only the right people get in by using strong passwords and watching for suspicious logins. In case of ask for password recovery, it's important to make sure the right person is asking for that (In some cases the attacker might ask for new password, so strong authentication is needed)

##### Tampering:

Risk: Someone might mess with patient records or prescriptions without permission.
How to Stay Safe: Keep data safe and unchanged by checking it regularly and making sure only authorized people can make changes. (precious ways + secure monitoring in doctor side to see who is modifying the data, proper access management)

##### Repudiation:

Risk: Someone might try to deny doing something wrong or change records. (Some changes might not be recognized in the first step)
How to Stay Safe: Keep track of what people do and ensure records stay accurate. For instance, ask the patient to verify information like credentials when making any reservation. Additionally, track changes in relevant files and the database. 

##### Information Disclosure:

Risk: Private patient info could end up in the wrong hands. In this case, not only credentials but also stories and secrets might be stolen.
How to Stay Safe: Keep patient data private by encrypting it, using strong passwords, controlling who can access it, and regularly checking who's looking at it. Also, identify and eliminate robots that may try to access the data.

##### Denial of Service:

Risk: Someone (or some other reason like memory limitation) might try to stop the patient app from working.
How to Stay Safe: Keep the app working by preparing for attacks, having backups, and making sure it can handle lots of users. It is important to plan for what we should expect.

##### Elevation of Privilege:

Risk: Someone might try to get more access than they should have. For example, patients' family might have access to a part of data, but they shouldn't see the doctor's notes and patients' stories.
How to Stay Safe: Control who gets access and check regularly to make sure everyone has the right level of access. For example, by creating separate tables for personal information and secrets from file numbers and names, and using a code like file number as the primary key to relate tables, we can make the data more secure. It's not like everyone can see everything by looking at one table.

#### Priority Risks:
The biggest worries are about private info being exposed, then someone will misuse it. and someone messing with patient records, then it can interfere with the treatment process. These are the most important to watch out for.

#### Expected Value:
Even though it's hard to know the exact numbers, the risks of unauthorized access and messing with data are probably the most serious. It will be easier by considering that data can be used for different aims.

#### Targeted by Bad People:
Because the clinic has valuable patient info, bad people might want to get in and use it for the wrong reasons. Bad people is not only the attackers for a criminal reason, but it can be patient's sister who wants get advantage by knowing some secrets from patient.

#### Known Tricks:
Bad people might use tricks like trying to get past passwords or getting a new password by convincing people that they are the patient, hacking the system, lack of access management which can end up with giving data to the wrong person.

### What are we going to do about it?

To Stay Safe:
We can do a few things to keep everything secure:

Reduce Attack Surface: Make it harder for bad people to get in by tightening up security. Like having strong password and encrypt it, ask security questions, do proper access management etc.

Limit Entry Points: Control how people can get into our system. Only let them in where it's necessary. (For example, a patient's sister doesn't need full access, even if it is defined in the related files, because of patient privacy.)

Choose From:
We have some options:

Reduce: Make things smaller and simpler to have fewer problems. Making the system complicated can increase the chance of attack, because there can be many ways for the bad people to get into unwanted information.

Transfer: Shift some responsibilities to others, like using a secure service, and automate some system for decreasing human failures.

Avoid: Stay away from things that might be risky. like asking for the information that is not neccessary, or giving access to someone who doesn't need that.

Accept: Sometimes, we just need to deal with a bit of risk. For example if patient forget the password we should define a way for the recovery, although it might increase risk of attack.

### Did we do a good enough job?

To Check:
We need to regularly check if everything is still safe:

Security Audits: Get experts to review our security measures, and do some mock attacks to measure system's safety.

Pentests: Test our defenses to find weak spots.

Assessments: Regularly check how well we're doing. for example by measuring number of attacks that happened and how the system dealed with the issue.

Continuous Threat Modeling and Evaluation: Always keep an eye out for new risks and make sure our safety measures are up to date.

In generall, if we recommend this system to someone else, means we're doing good enough.
