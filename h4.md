### Applied Cryptography:

- When someone wants to send a secret message to someone else, they become the sender and the person receiving the message is the receiver.
- They want to ensure that no one else can understand the message. To do this, they use encryption.
- Encryption is like hiding the message. The original message is called plaintext, and after it's hidden, it becomes ciphertext.
- To turn the hidden message back into its original form, you need to decrypt it.
- The study of keeping messages secret is called cryptography, and those who practice it are called cryptographers.
- There are also people called cryptanalysts who try to uncover hidden messages. The math involved in both hiding and uncovering messages is called cryptology.
- Plaintext can be any kind of information, like text, images, or sounds.
  

### Disobey 2023:
#### Cyber Security is everyone's business - Lotta Sandroos:

- cybersecurity is everyone's responsibility, especially for home users, so  it is important to educate home users about cyber threats.
- They emphasize the need for a positive and encouraging approach to cybersecurity communication rather than relying solely on fear tactics.
- Adoption of targeted educational content based on participants' experience and skill level
- Getting service providers more involved in cybersecurity education can help reach more people, while improving ways to motivate behavior change in cybersecurity can make everyone safer.

## a)
First we should set up trust. We generated key pairs for both Alice and Kiana, and exchanged public keys to establish trust between them. This ensures that messages can be securely encrypted and verified.

After importing and signing alice public key in Kiana environment. You can see two firgerprints, first is kiana's and second is for Alice:

My challanges: My virtual machine was not letting me to copy commands from website to command line, so I changed the setting in machine. But then after a while I faced with black screen, 
and I needed to change the setting again. (but then I realized it's not because of that. it's a bug)

Alice encrypted her message using Kiana's public key, ensuring that only Tero can decrypt and read it. She also signed the message with her own private key to verify its authenticity.

The encrypted message was transferred over an untrusted network, simulating sending it over the internet.

Kiana decrypted the message using her private key and verified Alice's signature using her public key. This ensured that the message was indeed from Alice and hadn't been tampered with during transit.
