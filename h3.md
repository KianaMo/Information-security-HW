### A05
An application may be vulnerable if:
- lack of security hardening in any part of application.
- It has unneccesary features
- default accounts and passwords are not changed.
- Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users. (If something goes wrong in the computer program, it might tell too much information to the user, like showing a list of steps it took (called a stack trace). This can give away details that could be used by someone with bad intentions. It's like the computer being too chatty about its problems and unintentionally sharing too much.)
- When a computer system gets updated, sometimes the newest safety features are not turned on or set up in a safe way.
- Security settings in application servers, frameworks, libraries, databases, etc., are not set to secure values.
- Security headers or directives are not sent or not set to secure values.
- The software is outdated or vulnerable.
For a safe setup we can considere these:
- Use a quick and repeatable process to make new secure environments.
- Keep environments the same but use different credentials.
- Remove unnecessary stuff and avoid adding unused features.
- Stay updated on security changes and review cloud storage permissions.
- Keep things separate and secure in the application.
- Tell clients about security measures and check settings automatically.

 ### A06
  An application may be vulnerable if:
  - if you don't know vwesion of used components.
  - if the software is outdated or unsupported.
  - If you don't regularly check for problems in your computer stuff and subscribe to updates about its security.
  - If you do not modify or upgrade the platform, frameworks and underlying dependencies on time.
  - If updated, upgraded or patched libraries are not tested for compatibility by developers.
  - If you do not secure the component settings
Stay safe by having a plan to update your computer stuff. Here's what to do:
  - Remove things you don't need, like extra features.
  - Keep track of your computer parts and watch for problems using tools.
  - Only get parts from safe places with secure links.
  - Look out for parts that don't get fixed and find a way to protect against issues.
  - Every organization should have a plan to keep everything up to date and safe.

### A03
 An application is vulnerable to attack when:
 - The data provided by the user is not verified, filtered or cleaned by the application.
 - If you use instructions in a computer program without protecting them properly, it can cause problems.
 - If mean or harmful information is put into a way of searching for things in a computer program, it can be used to get more private or secret information.
 - If mean or harmful information is directly used or added together with computer commands, like in searching or telling the computer what to do, it can cause problems.
To avoid problems like injecting harmful data into computer commands, it's best to use a secure way to communicate with the computer, such as a secure API. If you must use special characters, be sure to check them on the server side. Also, be careful with dynamic queries and escape special characters properly. Remember, some things like table names cannot be protected, so be careful with them. And to avoid providing too much information, limit and control what the computer shows when it searches for records.

Here, with this injection: '+OR+1=1-- in this query: SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1 "--" will turn "released=1" into a comment, rendering it unreadable. Consequently, everything, including unreleased products, will be visible to everyone.

Injecting code into systems can be done in different ways. I enjoyed and found this task useful. An interesting incident occurred during subtask 13 when I asked about dropping a table. I wanted ChatGPT to check my query and tell me what was wrong with it. However, ChatGPT refused, stating it couldn't help with illegal activities. I explained it was just a lab task, not a real crime.
