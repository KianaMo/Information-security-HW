## 1)Darknet diaries

At first it took so long for me to find a story which is really relevant to subject, They all looked they are related to the subject information security, after 10 minutes I 
found the subject not so relevant to the course. Finally I found out this which was interesting to me.

### THE PIZZA PROBLEM

The story revolves around an individual who was an early adopter of social media platforms, allowing him to secure unique usernames for all his accounts. This uniqueness caught the attention of many, resulting in numerous offers to purchase his accounts. Initially, he dismissed these offers, but one day, a particular buyer engaged him in a lengthy conversation, which eventually led to a phone call. Suddenly, he realized that his phone was no longer functioning, and he discovered that he had fallen victim to a "SIM-swap" attack.

In a SIM-swap attack, the perpetrators convince the SIM operator to transfer the phone number to a new SIM card. With access to his phone number, they gained control of his social media accounts, changing passwords and locking him out. Despite regaining access to his accounts and obtaining a new phone number, the harasser continued to target him. The hacker spent time uncovering the victim's real name, family information, and even the new phone number, escalating the harassment.
The situation became more troubling as the harasser began ordering pizzas to the victim's name and address, with frequent visits to his residence. The victim realized that this form of harassment could escalate further, involving false calls to taxis and the police. The relentless attacks extended to the victim's family, and despite seeking help from the police, they lacked the necessary knowledge to address the case effectively.

Discovering that the attacker worked in the tech industry, specifically for a cybersecurity company, added a disheartening layer to the situation. It was distressing to realize that someone employed in cybersecurity chose to spend their time harassing others instead of utilizing their skills to help people. Unfortunately, law enforcement's limited knowledge in handling such cases exacerbated the victim's challenges.

It's really sad that some hackers try to get unique usernames to either sell them or cause trouble for others. Making sure our online accounts are safe is crucial to stop this kind of harassment. I appreciate that the person in the story started using PIN codes after the first attack to make their accounts more secure. It's also important for the police to learn more about cyber attacks through simple courses. This way, they can better understand and handle these online threats, making the digital world safer for everyone.

#### 2)LM-White-Paper-Intel-Driven-Defense 

In the field of cybersecurity, traditional tools like antivirus and intrusion detection focus on fixing weaknesses in computer systems. However, the rise of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) brings a new challenge, with highly skilled attackers targeting crucial information using advanced tools that standard defenses struggle against. To tackle this, an essential approach called intelligence-driven computer network defense (CND) comes into play. This method utilizes information about attackers to create an intelligence loop, enabling defenders to stay ahead of the game. Understanding the various phases of attacks and linking them into broader patterns improves defense effectiveness, not only reducing the likelihood of successful attacks but also guiding strategic defense investments and offering valuable performance metrics. The intelligence-based model proves especially crucial in countering advanced threats, going beyond fixing vulnerabilities to directly confront the threat itself.

The "kill chain" depicts a systematic process employed by attackers to target and engage adversaries. Translated to computer intrusions, it outlines phases such as reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Defenders can enhance their capabilities aligned with these phases. For instance, during the exploitation phase, host intrusion detection systems can spot exploits, patching can thwart exploitation, and data execution prevention can disrupt the exploit. The aim is to establish a robust defense against persistent adversaries, compelling them to make comprehensive adjustments to achieve their goals. Metrics play a pivotal role in gauging the effectiveness of defensive actions and increasing the cost for attackers. The model facilitates adaptive defense strategies by incorporating insights gained from indicators revealed in each intrusion attempt.
